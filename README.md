# Panacea JSON Schema Repository

This repository is for keeping track of JSON schemas created by the Panacea team, especially for running/testing Data Exchange Protocol.


## Development Guide

To create a new JSON schema, please see the [Understanding JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/index.html) guide.
Also, you can use an [online JSON schema generator](https://www.jsonschema.net/), but you may need to modify the generated schema by adding more requirements.

Before pushing your changes to this repository, you can validate your JSON schema with your example JSON files using the [online JSON schema validator](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/).


## Deployment Guide

This repository is published as https://jsonschema.gopanacea.org or http://jsonschema.gopanacea.org.

For that deployment, the Panacea team uses AWS S3. Please contact the Panacea team if you want to deploy your changes officially.
